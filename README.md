# TermRPG

An rpg game to play through terminal.
The program uses ncurses's library for display and interactability to create
a sorts of a TUI, text user interface.
The goal of this project is to offer a fun and casual game, with a retro
style, you can play directly from your terminal.

- As new features are implemented this file will be updated.

- At moment the game is still unplayable, only 'New game' option in start is
interactable.

- All start menu options are now fully interactable, but
'Controls' and 'Options' aren't fully completed (more options to had in the
future).

- Background music added through the mplayer program and is working as desired
(mplayer is required for it to work or you can change the line in
terminal_rpg_music.c where mplayer is mentioned).
