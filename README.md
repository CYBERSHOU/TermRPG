# TermRPG

An rpg game to play through terminal.
The program uses ncurses's library for display and interactability to create
a sorts of a TUI, text user interface.
The goal of this project is to offer a fun and casual game, with a retro
style, you can play directly from your terminal.

- As new features are implemented this file will be updated.

- At moment the game is still unplayable.

- All menu options but 'Start' are now fully interactable, but
'Controls' and 'Options' aren't fully completed (more options
to had in the future).
